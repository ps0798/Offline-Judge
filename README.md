# What is Offline-Judge ?

Offline-Judge also called Openjudge is a LAN based program judging implementation in Python.  
Almost all institutes have a computer science department or an IT department, nowadays.  
Very often, these departments organise programming contests.

+ `Eighty per cent of the time, the programs are checked manually`
+ `A lot of people participate`
+ `People prefer the contests to be online (like codechef.com)`
+ `Offline events have their own charm and draw large crowds`

The advantages offered by offline program judges are numerous:
